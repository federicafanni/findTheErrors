# FIND THE ERROR GAME

## Description
This simple Python program is designed to help users practice identifying and correcting syntax errors in code. 
The program presents the user with a broken piece of code and prompts them to enter the corrected version. The process continues until the user successfully provides the correct syntax.

## Features
- **While loop**: The program uses a while loop that continues until the user enters the correct line of code.
- **Strings comparison**: User input is compared with the correct sentence (converting the strings into sets and identifying the differences), and appropriate feedback is provided counting the amount of errors to fix.

## Installation
